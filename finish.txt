BEGIN NOW   I sit and stare for a second. END
BEGIN NOW   I try really hard to not chew my fingernails. END
BEGIN NOW My mind is blanker than the paper, because it doesn’t have the horizontal blue lines for neatness. END
BEGIN NOW   I look down at my hands and decide that the extra fine precise v5 pen looks kind of like a hypodermic needle filled with ink. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe it’s actually gray matter that I sucked out of my very own brain via the nasal passage, and now I am scratching down words with it. END
BEGIN NOW Still somewhere, I can hear the echo…  “create me!”  Maybe it’s coming from outside. END
BEGIN NOW   I glace at the door, and decide I don’t really care. END

BEGIN NOW   The door is locked and I dance across the horizontal mural of language and laugh to myself as a ‘J’ drapes across the bridge of my nose, wet and slimey, freshly seeped from the walls and ceiling steeped like tea in my existence. END
BEGIN NOW   I’m the prince of this rainforest most verbose. END
BEGIN NOW   In the corner under the bed is a spot the letters never drop onto. END
BEGIN NOW   I even moved the bed, but the letters slide off like egg yolks in oil. END
BEGIN NOW   So I try a new approach. END
BEGIN NOW   I grab a handful of letters that have slid into the corners and grind them in a blender into tye dye paste. END
BEGIN NOW   I water it down with whiskey, and feed it back into the ceiling using a drip system. END
BEGIN NOW   I lay down a canvas, specially made to soak up whiskey mess. END
BEGIN NOW   But I digress. END

BEGIN NOW Like the shroud of Turin. END
BEGIN NOW The power held within. END
BEGIN NOW Burns its image immortally. END

BEGIN NOW On Feet. END
BEGIN NOW Lately I’ve been looking up from my feet,. END
BEGIN NOW And realizing I’m already in the middle of the street. END
BEGIN NOW As if my feet had proclaimed it was safe ride of way. END

BEGIN NOW A faint rumble from the foreground, perhaps indigestion. END
BEGIN NOW The liver sun crawls behind the horizon. END
BEGIN NOW Rest weary, sweet poison sucker…. END
BEGIN NOW Sharp Edges. END
BEGIN NOW It’s a terrible grinding scraping noise. END
BEGIN NOW It reeks of burning trash. END
BEGIN NOW It’s the sharp edge of metal and stinging nettle. END
BEGIN NOW There’s dirt on my teeth and dust on my tongue. END
BEGIN NOW And I’m staring at the girl I love. END
BEGIN NOW Redial. END
BEGIN NOW       (fragments). END

BEGIN NOW   And …  … never able to marry into his social strata without undue drama. END
BEGIN NOW   He’s pacing now…   …walks into the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   His eyes are creeping me out. END
BEGIN NOW   Like drilling holes through bone. END
BEGIN NOW   Ugh~  look at his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW   He’s bleeding from his fingernails. END
BEGIN NOW   This chick has officially gotten under his skin. END
BEGIN NOW   To the point where he’s staining bloody fingerprints on everything he touches. END
BEGIN NOW   And he doesn’t seem aware of it. END
BEGIN NOW   Except when he hits redial. END
BEGIN NOW   You see him flinch from the bared soft pink skin where the nail used to be now being used as a prodding utensil. END
BEGIN NOW   His knuckles stopped popping an hour ago, and the smoking doesn’t seem to be helping, and he’s grinding his teeth, but like sideways, so it makes more of a squeak than a grinding noise. END
BEGIN NOW   Like something’s about to pop loose. END
BEGIN NOW You can tell he has a stiff neck, and watching him force it around like bruce lee, and the nasty popping sounds. END
BEGIN NOW   Oh lordy. END
BEGIN NOW   He’s goin for another cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW   He looks tired. END
BEGIN NOW   His face has slumped, a collapsing circus tent. END
BEGIN NOW   The crazies looks have dissipated from his face. END
BEGIN NOW   The circus freak emotion movements of rattling bones and picking at stickers seem to have subsided. END
BEGIN NOW   He looks down at his hands, and he seems to be accepting them as his own. END
BEGIN NOW   As if now, upon being beaten, he can stop acting like a jackass. END
BEGIN NOW   His eyes wander up and rest on the phone. END
BEGIN NOW   He picks it up, like it’s a small delicate tranquilized creature, and with a sudden burst of movement, he hurls the phone through the window. END
BEGIN NOW The sound of glass breaking has this resounding finality to it. END
BEGIN NOW Very much unlike a ringing phone. END

BEGIN NOW A good nap. END

BEGIN NOW The Jessica Special. END
BEGIN NOW From a special Jessica. END
BEGIN NOW The most tragic of things. END
BEGIN NOW Is sleeping next to someone. END
BEGIN NOW Of great personal significance. END
BEGIN NOW Unable to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Because my heart won’t stop pounding. END
BEGIN NOW Because I’m not used to sleeping with. END
BEGIN NOW Someone. END
BEGIN NOW So I lay awake. END
BEGIN NOW Holding a dream come true. END
BEGIN NOW As close as possible. END
BEGIN NOW Because in the morning, you never know. END
BEGIN NOW In the morning anything can happen. END
BEGIN NOW And I’d rather lie in bed. END
BEGIN NOW Holding my dream. END
BEGIN NOW Then deal with work. END
BEGIN NOW Or social obligations. END
BEGIN NOW I’d rather drift in and out of consciousness. END
BEGIN NOW But never make it all the way out. END
BEGIN NOW Life is too short to wake up from this. END
BEGIN NOW If neglecting me was a profitable enterprise. END
BEGIN NOW You’d be a millionaire by now. END
BEGIN NOW Someday, I hope I don’t care about you. END
BEGIN NOW As much as you don’t care about me. END
BEGIN NOW One of these days, someone else will give a damn. END
BEGIN NOW In Recent Memory of Trout Fishing in America. END
BEGIN NOW Cold steel spinning bait thrown out. END
BEGIN NOW Overcastting a line to the opposite shore. END
BEGIN NOW Where the lure slaps at a rock before. END
BEGIN NOW Tumbling into a gap between the stones. END
BEGIN NOW Where the line snaps. END
BEGIN NOW And my lure is lost. END
BEGIN NOW Between two moss slicked stones. END
BEGIN NOW And the water moves along. END
BEGIN NOW With rapid apathy. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, I feel as though. END
BEGIN NOW I should keep every good thing that. END
BEGIN NOW Happens to me. END
BEGIN NOW A secret. END
BEGIN NOW Because if anyone finds out. END
BEGIN NOW It may all just disappear. END
BEGIN NOW Like the flame from. END

BEGIN NOW Right After my wish. END
BEGIN NOW Comes true. END
BEGIN NOW Cold medication. END
BEGIN NOW Do you really do anything?. END
BEGIN NOW Supposedly you suppress coughs. END

BEGIN NOW I’m a little bitter. END
BEGIN NOW It would never work out anyway. END

BEGIN NOW About me. END
BEGIN NOW It’s for the best. END

BEGIN NOW Yours and mine. END
BEGIN NOW The cough came back. END
BEGIN NOW Come to think of it. END

BEGIN NOW I met a man named Joe. END
BEGIN NOW And another man named Natto. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t remember anything we said. END
BEGIN NOW Bar talk is cheaper. END
BEGIN NOW Than the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW Is there a luxury greater. END
BEGIN NOW Than smoking in bed?. END
BEGIN NOW All the money in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Or shiny cars. END
BEGIN NOW That smell like pine trees. END
BEGIN NOW Pine trees that are too. END
BEGIN NOW Expensive to obey speed limits. END
BEGIN NOW Oh water. END
BEGIN NOW Restore me to my feet. END
BEGIN NOW My tired feet. END
BEGIN NOW That need three more hours. END
BEGIN NOW Of restless napping. END
BEGIN NOW Oh water. END
BEGIN NOW Bathe me back to life. END
BEGIN NOW My tired life that needs rest. END
BEGIN NOW Or something like it. END
BEGIN NOW Oh water. END
BEGIN NOW Wash my glass. END
BEGIN NOW Give me the cold shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW And become ice cubes. END
BEGIN NOW Chill the whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW And water it down. END
BEGIN NOW Until the glass is. END

BEGIN NOW  Really. END
BEGIN NOW Stupid ears. END

BEGIN NOW Why?. END
BEGIN NOW Not. END
BEGIN NOW I sleep behind America. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I would be sleeping behind America. END
BEGIN NOW But I can’t do that. END
BEGIN NOW I’d rather sleep next to. END
BEGIN NOW Sleep with America. END
BEGIN NOW But America is just a flag. END
BEGIN NOW That is always sleeping. END
BEGIN NOW Unlike me. END
BEGIN NOW Who is always waking up. END
BEGIN NOW My hand smells like my balls. END
BEGIN NOW That’s predictable. END
BEGIN NOW It’s reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW Especially on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW When everything should smell like my balls. END
BEGIN NOW Mike has a cold instead of a cat. END
BEGIN NOW Or a dog (or a bitch). END
BEGIN NOW He had a ferret once. END
BEGIN NOW Last year or the one before. END
BEGIN NOW Can’t remember. END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a while. END
BEGIN NOW His cold gave birth to a litter. END
BEGIN NOW Of coughs and sneezes. END
BEGIN NOW And a few fevers. END
BEGIN NOW I took a cough home with me. END
BEGIN NOW He’s about six months old. END
BEGIN NOW I feed my cough cigarettes and beer. END
BEGIN NOW He sleeps on my bed and bathes with me. END
BEGIN NOW In the shower. END
BEGIN NOW I’m not so fond of him. END
BEGIN NOW But we’ve become attached to each other. END
BEGIN NOW I might raise him till he matures. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe into a cold. END
BEGIN NOW Or a disease. END
BEGIN NOW Or lung cancer. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he’ll run away. END
BEGIN NOW And join the hospital. END
BEGIN NOW I took my scrotum out for a spin. END
BEGIN NOW The other day. END
BEGIN NOW It was getting dusty. END
BEGIN NOW Down in the garage. END
BEGIN NOW The check engine light came on. END
BEGIN NOW All the mechanics wanted too much money. END
BEGIN NOW So I sat in the garage. END
BEGIN NOW With the motor running. END
BEGIN NOW Until the light went out. END
BEGIN NOW This poem is totally going to be five lines long. END
BEGIN NOW That’s real talk, I ain’t jiving you. END
BEGIN NOW  Seriously. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t pull that shit on you. END
BEGIN NOW   You’re too nice. END
BEGIN NOW But after five lines we’re calling it quits. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s pretty cool, being five lines long,” said this poem. END
BEGIN NOW “You’re such a liar,” I said. END
BEGIN NOW I hope the sleep study calls me back. END
BEGIN NOW I hope she lives with regrets. END
BEGIN NOW I hope I go out like fireworks. END
BEGIN NOW I hope Modern Drunkard likes my story. END
BEGIN NOW I hope the band goes on tour. END
BEGIN NOW I hope I can keep my job for a while. END
BEGIN NOW I hope this room lasts a while. END
BEGIN NOW I hope they find a cure. END
BEGIN NOW I hope I’m right about god. END
BEGIN NOW I hope she loves me. END
BEGIN NOW If all lines continue infinitely. END
BEGIN NOW Going on and on into the night. END
BEGIN NOW Then where do you draw the line?. END
BEGIN NOW How do you cross it?. END
BEGIN NOW Can a line be picked up?. END
BEGIN NOW Can it be stolen. END
BEGIN NOW Inhaled. END
BEGIN NOW Can it be traded bought, sold etc. END
BEGIN NOW Fuck Continuity. END
BEGIN NOW They have cutting rooms. END
BEGIN NOW For movies. END
BEGIN NOW But I want to start a dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW With that name. END
BEGIN NOW The Cutting Room. END
BEGIN NOW The décor would be very morbid. END
BEGIN NOW The patrons would giggle about suicide. END
BEGIN NOW I love everything about the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Except when it takes place. END
BEGIN NOW The Misfits. END
BEGIN NOW We exist by division,. END
BEGIN NOW Conflicting definitions,. END
BEGIN NOW Spracked out day dream hangover victims. END
BEGIN NOW On restroom walls. END
BEGIN NOW Manifestos pass for graffiti;. END
BEGIN NOW These chicken scratch chronicles. END
BEGIN NOW Sold from the trunk of a stolen Mercedes. END
BEGIN NOW Wild on whiskey we howl at a full moon. END
BEGIN NOW And laugh like shattering glass. END
BEGIN NOW The sounds of defiance waft heavenward. END
BEGIN NOW Like so many billowy clouds. END
BEGIN NOW Of Cigarette smoke. END
BEGIN NOW With hash crazy red-eyes. END
BEGIN NOW We peer into crystal strip malls. END
BEGIN NOW Pray to nothing in particular. END
BEGIN NOW And laughing, always laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Just another saliva soaked finger. END
BEGIN NOW Singing on the rim of a wine glass. END
BEGIN NOW I hear voices around every corner. END
BEGIN NOW That sound like stale beer,. END
BEGIN NOW Nestled in aluminum prisons. END
BEGIN NOW Half consumed under the unholy. END
BEGIN NOW Lidless, listless gaze. END
BEGIN NOW Of everything we hold. END
BEGIN NOW Dear. END
BEGIN NOW She cuts her lip on a Zig-Zag. END
BEGIN NOW And slices her tongue amidst. END
BEGIN NOW The screams of so much. END
BEGIN NOW White noise. END
BEGIN NOW She stands on a balcony. END
BEGIN NOW Bathed in the blood. END
BEGIN NOW Of her ever open mouth. END
BEGIN NOW We watch her dive like a china doll. END
BEGIN NOW With less than horror. END
BEGIN NOW In her eyes;. END
BEGIN NOW We sigh with envy. END
BEGIN NOW At her calm complacency. END
BEGIN NOW And her dream. END
BEGIN NOW Of a beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW Suicide. END
BEGIN NOW II. END
BEGIN NOW We gather again at the end of our wits;. END
BEGIN NOW Make plans  for a wake. END
BEGIN NOW I polish my minister�s badge. END
BEGIN NOW And write for her, a eulogy. END
BEGIN NOW She rests now; coffin bound in robes so silky sheen. END
BEGIN NOW Obscene scenesters hang their heads. END
BEGIN NOW Half in sorrow, half from the weight. END
BEGIN NOW Awaiting words regurgitated. END
BEGIN NOW Little chicks unable to chew, they sit on pews. END
BEGIN NOW Sending text messages. END
BEGIN NOW Throat cleared now and hrumph hum hum. END
BEGIN NOW You are not my dearly beloved,. END
BEGIN NOW My brothers and sisters and not family by any means. END
BEGIN NOW End now this silly charade and claim again. END
BEGIN NOW Your birthright;. END
BEGIN NOW Which is just to live as you see fit. END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you and your attention span. END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you in your head, not listening. END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you and your precious festering wounds. END
BEGIN NOW Your puckered lips are a cat�s asshole. END
BEGIN NOW Your words fall short like little shits. END
BEGIN NOW Sticking to the fur. END
BEGIN NOW I watch you when you fuck or copulate. END
BEGIN NOW Bang, buck, punk, pork, poke, prod your prick. END
BEGIN NOW Into musk scented love sockets. END
BEGIN NOW You are my pornography,. END
BEGIN NOW Lying in a casket. END
BEGIN NOW III. END
BEGIN NOW Days and weeks pass and skid. END
BEGIN NOW Grind by, halting here and there. END
BEGIN NOW Rap at a window late night. END
BEGIN NOW Let�s me know the time is right. END
BEGIN NOW A brick as thick as it gets smashes the silence. END
BEGIN NOW Red smatter shattering pane. END
BEGIN NOW She reaches in and grabs me by the neck. END
BEGIN NOW Drags me under a shot out street lamp. END
BEGIN NOW We camp a minute, flicking bics. END
BEGIN NOW And inhale deep down,. END
BEGIN NOW Returning wide eyed and ready. END
BEGIN NOW Grasping hands we run off into pitch black. END
BEGIN NOW Promises of promiscuous perversions. END
BEGIN NOW She hangs a leg out of the window of a car. END
BEGIN NOW Letting wind whip her three days unshaven legs. END
BEGIN NOW Her face facing starry ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW Sings a battle cry at hitch hikers;. END
BEGIN NOW A thumbs up serenade. END
BEGIN NOW To the tune of Isn�t it Romantic. END
BEGIN NOW We drive a hot hatchback into the waves. END
BEGIN NOW And cheer at mermaids. END
BEGIN NOW Bastet sits on the shore. END
BEGIN NOW Basking in the glow. END
BEGIN NOW Of our collective cheerful absurdity. END
BEGIN NOW She runs thin nicotine stained fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Through hat perfect hair,. END
BEGIN NOW Kisses her finger tips. END
BEGIN NOW And muahs at nothing at all. END
BEGIN NOW Give �em hell, give �em hell. END
BEGIN NOW And break the spell of boredom. END
BEGIN NOW Badass china doll face breaks no fasts. END
BEGIN NOW In the lanes of the happy highways. END
BEGIN NOW Pulling blind corners, pausing. END
BEGIN NOW Only to lurch four letter words off the tongue of a mute. END
BEGIN NOW We shoot shit like it means something. END
BEGIN NOW These small talk soliloquies have only the dim reflection. END
BEGIN NOW Of it�s so nice to see you again. END
BEGIN NOW Now motionless lips and wandering eyes,. END
BEGIN NOW Indulging in the semi-awkward silence. END
BEGIN NOW West cliff. END
BEGIN NOW There’s a lighthouse on the point. END
BEGIN NOW The beacon years out of use. END
BEGIN NOW It stands majestically neglected. END
BEGIN NOW Lacking in ships to guide in. END
BEGIN NOW Replaced now by years decades of navigational technology. END
BEGIN NOW It’s true what they say. END
BEGIN NOW How you only see couples when you’re single. END
BEGIN NOW Their happiness in direct proportion to how lonely. END
BEGIN NOW You are when they pass by, arm in arm. END
BEGIN NOW Hand in Hand. END
BEGIN NOW Lips to Lips. END
BEGIN NOW Out of eye corners I keep catching glimpses. END
BEGIN NOW Of golden curled short strawberry blondes. END
BEGIN NOW The face is never right. END
BEGIN NOW Or the figure. END
BEGIN NOW But I still double take. END
BEGIN NOW Look again just to check. END
BEGIN NOW Knowing full well the impossible implications. END
BEGIN NOW There’s this lighthouse on the point. END
BEGIN NOW The city turned it into a surf museum. END
BEGIN NOW Someday I’d like to take you there. END
BEGIN NOW And hold, embrace kiss you deep. END
BEGIN NOW While a swell curls, breaks and crashes. END
BEGIN NOW On the rocks below,. END
BEGIN NOW Sending snowy foam wave debris scattered. END
BEGIN NOW Upwards and out. END
BEGIN NOW Grasping in vain at the seagulls. END
BEGIN NOW That refuse to do anything but shit everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW And Soar away. END
BEGIN NOW (untitled). END
BEGIN NOW You can try to hold it waiting for a moment. END
BEGIN NOW A space a place in time. END
BEGIN NOW A spot so quiet that you dare to scream. END
BEGIN NOW No one calls the cops out of fear. END
BEGIN NOW For the one guy doing what’s on everyone’s mind. END
BEGIN NOW Engage this sense desensitized. END
BEGIN NOW And realize for the first and last time. END
BEGIN NOW That these dreams so fading with waking. END
BEGIN NOW And split second stops. END
BEGIN NOW For Ben Raymond. END
BEGIN NOW History Repeating. END
BEGIN NOW A ballad sent forth from the lips. END
BEGIN NOW The thrusting hips of water closet hookups. END
BEGIN NOW Of drunken game spit. END
BEGIN NOW Of empty bottle balancing acts. END
BEGIN NOW Of Cigarette butt happy endings. END
BEGIN NOW All the while in tie and funeral shirt. END
BEGIN NOW The great observer taking notes. END
BEGIN NOW On eavesdropped conversation snippets. END
BEGIN NOW The modern writer, on track minding a storehouse of memories. END
BEGIN NOW That orbit around the previous center of the universe. END
BEGIN NOW The sun around the earth despite science. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of logic and lunacy. END
BEGIN NOW Always in transition to hangover. END
BEGIN NOW Tickling a notebook to coax out clichés. END
BEGIN NOW Reworded to subtle brilliance. END
BEGIN NOW For Moe Moe. END
BEGIN NOW She walks like a jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW Whistle then hums then singing out loud. END
BEGIN NOW The top forty hits echoing off housing structures. END
BEGIN NOW All alone taking courage by breaking the dead of night silence. END
BEGIN NOW Of Foreigner decent, shedding the remnants of common decency. END
BEGIN NOW And the strangers looking on at her vocal straining lunacy. END
BEGIN NOW Nose in a book always. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes tracing retracing the same paragraph. END
BEGIN NOW She bums out filters by request. END
BEGIN NOW Lamenting the new voids in a quickly draining half pack. END
BEGIN NOW And sustenance dictates departure. END
BEGIN NOW While shame faced dumb dogs nap in the back of station wagons. END
BEGIN NOW We drain a twelve pack in her parking lot. END
BEGIN NOW And ill lit games of hacky sack refuse to end. END
BEGIN NOW Swill with us this two buck chuck. END
BEGIN NOW And Duck swaps jokes between swigs of beer. END
BEGIN NOW With a tossed brunette boy, restless and awaiting. END
BEGIN NOW Road trips. END
BEGIN NOW For Bitchnuts. END
BEGIN NOW The patron saint of strip clubs. END
BEGIN NOW Beer guzzling bald headed. END
BEGIN NOW Receding hairline harbinger. END
BEGIN NOW I held you up post bull riding. END
BEGIN NOW As you staggered force footed up the stairs. END
BEGIN NOW Into the caring arms of cousins who love you. END
BEGIN NOW Bury your face in the massive flesh pillows. END
BEGIN NOW After awkward shower sex scenes. END
BEGIN NOW My windbreaker is somewhere on your floor. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere between the Maxims and Bud Light bottles. END
BEGIN NOW Burnt out butts on your balcony. END
BEGIN NOW My would be brother in law. END
BEGIN NOW Empty rum bottle battles. END
BEGIN NOW On clock intoxicated escapades. END
BEGIN NOW And dangerous flirtations with no longer underage waitresses. END
BEGIN NOW I could palm her whole ass one handed. END
BEGIN NOW Half Asian half sisters and you on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW With the man stealing ho bag. END
BEGIN NOW And the bitchy roommate that called me creepy. END
BEGIN NOW When really she’s just a shitty hostess. END
BEGIN NOW And a filthy little mudshark. END
BEGIN NOW Downloading Counting Crows songs on the couch. END
BEGIN NOW Pervasive pole dancer leaves jaws dropped. END
BEGIN NOW Girls with envy. END
BEGIN NOW The culmination of years of study. END
BEGIN NOW And rows of dollar bill pyramids. END
BEGIN NOW Movie quoting manwhore. END
BEGIN NOW Bitch nuts forever and I hope you never grow up. END
BEGIN NOW Pac Ave. END
BEGIN NOW Pacific Avenue is my real home. END
BEGIN NOW Where I go no matter how I feel. END
BEGIN NOW To be distracted in your bookshops. END
BEGIN NOW To waste countless hours between a half dozen cafes. END
BEGIN NOW To devour all those slices from Rockers, Pizza and Grille, Pizza My Heart. END
BEGIN NOW I love you and your kelp’d beaches. END
BEGIN NOW Your bumming Boardwalk, filthy sidewalk littered with tourists. END
BEGIN NOW Your bums harass me constantly. END
BEGIN NOW The street urchins refuse to let me be. END
BEGIN NOW For cigarettes, spare change, petition signatures. END
BEGIN NOW Bus fare and booze money. END
BEGIN NOW You panhandling persistent poor. END
BEGIN NOW I wish you’d just get a fucking job. END
BEGIN NOW And Leave me alone. END
BEGIN NOW Santa Cruz, you are a paradox unto yourself. END
BEGIN NOW An enigma never at peace. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t like it when you tone it down. END
BEGIN NOW I like you wild and weird,. END
BEGIN NOW Your grown up hippies and all too quickly matured street kids. END
BEGIN NOW I miss you when I leave. END
BEGIN NOW I’d kiss you goodbye but I’m not so fond of disease. END
BEGIN NOW I’ll blow it your way flying down 17. END
BEGIN NOW Watch you catch it between what remains of your meth stained teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Heartbreaker. END
BEGIN NOW What she lacks in chest. END
BEGIN NOW She makes up for in legs and ass. END
BEGIN NOW Change color hair, straight and elegant. END
BEGIN NOW With deep brown doe eyes that hypnotize and tease. END
BEGIN NOW She’s a hell of a saleswoman. END
BEGIN NOW And a gold digging bitch. END
BEGIN NOW She’ll show up on your doorstep at three in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Looking scared and helpless. END
BEGIN NOW Barfly and hellion, hell raiser and Helen of Troy. END
BEGIN NOW We gave you a nine point two and clapped when you walked in the room. END
BEGIN NOW Oblivious heartbreaker. END
BEGIN NOW And I timed my smoke breaks around you;. END
BEGIN NOW Always a perfect gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW For Mikey. END
BEGIN NOW Gazing towards heaven,. END
BEGIN NOW But it’s only space. END
BEGIN NOW Empty infinite boarding school for Stars. END
BEGIN NOW And I linger on. END
BEGIN NOW Lying on the floors of saints. END
BEGIN NOW Wallowing in their unclean carpets. END
BEGIN NOW Wishing on a painted moon. END
BEGIN NOW I wake only to find. END
BEGIN NOW The fading memory of a dream. END
BEGIN NOW That left me blue balled. END
BEGIN NOW The Scientific Method. END
BEGIN NOW It’s thirty-six inches from me to you. END
BEGIN NOW Measuring tape seldom lies. END
BEGIN NOW  Retracts with a snap. END
BEGIN NOW Recoils and whirs. END
BEGIN NOW Extending again to find the extent. END
BEGIN NOW And no, not the former habitat of past camping trips. END
BEGIN NOW Stretch up and out to cards long ago shuffled. END
BEGIN NOW And it’s sixty-three inches from you to aces. END
BEGIN NOW Misplaced poker hands stuck with invisible adhesives. END
BEGIN NOW Making a map of potential pot winners. END
BEGIN NOW Granting solace to chip holders. END
BEGIN NOW We measure again a means to an end. END
BEGIN NOW It’s fifty-four inches before you go. END
BEGIN NOW The distance to broken doorways with still working locks. END
BEGIN NOW Soon passing through your feet clad in shoes. END
BEGIN NOW Or your sole bared in flip-flops. END
BEGIN NOW On Sexual Frustration. END
BEGIN NOW Big fan of summertime. END
BEGIN NOW Summertime with short skirts. END
BEGIN NOW And low riding hip huggers. END
BEGIN NOW Halter top heroin. END
BEGIN NOW Just let me inject interjections. END
BEGIN NOW And rejection junkies on a sidewalk fix. END
BEGIN NOW Cleavage peeks from the bosoms and blossoms. END
BEGIN NOW Tank top titters and sniggering giggles. END
BEGIN NOW Give rise, give rise. END
BEGIN NOW And Christ alive a little release. END
BEGIN NOW Meticulously catalog the hunched over. END
BEGIN NOW Un-pantied ass cracks,. END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant distractions compliments of Levi Strauss. END
BEGIN NOW I can’t protest the way women dress. END
BEGIN NOW In this season of heat. END
BEGIN NOW You can only admire, be pleased by the tease;. END
BEGIN NOW Sultry skin scenes played out between shoulder blades. END
BEGIN NOW Leggy lovers spreading rumors amongst other things. END
BEGIN NOW Only imagine the treasures hidden under very impractical shorts. END
BEGIN NOW Eye catching ankle tattoos give me kicks. END
BEGIN NOW And people watching is always cheaper than strip clubs. END
BEGIN NOW Until you get home, dead bolted door behind you. END
BEGIN NOW And engage in purely utilitarian masturbation rituals. END
BEGIN NOW Sowing your seeds in crumpled tissues. END
BEGIN NOW Just to empty out excess body fluids. END
